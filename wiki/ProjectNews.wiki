= Other Announcements =

== 2010-10-12 Wiki overhaul ==

I did a major overhaul of the wiki and the content on it as well as adding more content. 

== 2010-10-08 Project Owner Change == 

The project has been dormant for too long and as of today has been taken over by Manfred Moser http://www.simpligility.com. Thanks to Karl Davies for past project creation and maintenance

In the near term the following steps are planned:

  * applying some of my own patches
  * applying some patches I received from various other community members
  * updating the wiki to reflect the new state
  * various other tasks that might come up
  * create a new release
  * maybe publish artifacts to Maven Central in the longer run..

We will create issues for all these tasks shortly and track progress with the issue tracker.

A new mailing list has been created so please feel free to join the list and post any ideas or questions there.

Manfred

== 2009-08-16, Development Status ==

My apologies for the long hiatus in updates to this project.  I was actually quite surprised to discover today that others were making use of it.  I just pushed out a new release (2.3) to resolve the issues folks were having making use of it.

If you'd like to help contribute to this project, please let me know.  I'll try to put up a page with build instructions sometime in the near future.
