#summary A brief history how this project came about

Long ago there was the ksoap and then the ksoap2 projects. After a successful phase SOAP and with it the library pretty much died. 

Android then revived that since a lightweight framework to talk to legacy SOAP services was needed. 

A patchset emerged for Android [http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/9b246db7d612a6b5/5735094a5196c783?lnk=gst&q=ksoap2&pli=1# emerged] on the "Android Developers" Google group authored by [http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=Ey3jEg8AAACg1wBgVrjM04pX08V0u_rp Jorge Jimenez].

Karl Davies then took this patchset, set up a properApache Maven build as well as this project and did a few releases.

Since the project was largely unmaintained [http://www.simpligility.com Manfred Moser] took over the project, updated the wiki, created a mailinglist, applied and created further patches and released 2.5.1.
