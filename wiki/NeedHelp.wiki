The documentation for ksoap2-android is quite sparse but most other documentation that you find on the internet about ksoap2 applies as well.

== Wiki and links == 

We aim to provide additional documentation here on the wiki and you will be able to find hints and help in the mailing list as well.
And check out some of the tutorials from the [Links] wiki page.


== Mailing list == 

Join the mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/ksoap2-android] as it is the main forum for discussion and help. Please send any questions there.

== Stackoverflow == 

You can also create a question on Stackoverflow and use the ksoap2 and android tags and we might find your question there.. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ksoap2]



== Source and Javadoc == 

A very good source of documentation are the javadoc as well as the source both of which you can find in the project Maven repository. Of course the source code is also on github.. 

e.g.
[http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-base/3.0.0-RC.2/ksoap2-base-3.0.0-RC.2-javadoc.jar]

[http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-base/3.0.0-RC.2/ksoap2-base-3.0.0-RC.2-sources.jar]

If you use Maven it will all be hooked up into your IDE automatically and you can browse the source and documentation right during development.

To do the same with Ant or plain Android Development Toolkit (Eclipse plugin) based environment you will have to manually download the [http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/#svn/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/ source and javadoc jar files from the assembly project].
