#summary What to do if you need help

The documentation for ksoap2-android is quite sparse but most other documentation that you find on the internet about ksoap2 applies as well.

We aim to provide additional documentation here on the wiki and you will be able to find hints and help in the mailing list as well.

A very good source of documentation are the javadoc as well as the source both of which you can find in the project Maven repository.

If you use Maven it will all be hooked up into your IDE automatically and you can browse the source and documentation right during development.

To do the same with Ant or plain Android Development Toolkit (Eclipse plugin) based environment you will have to manually download the [http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/#svn/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/2.5.2 source and javadoc jar files from the assembly project].

Join the mailing list [http://groups.google.com/group/ksoap2-android] as it is the main forum for discussion and help. Please send any questions there.

You can also create a question on Stackoverflow and use the ksoap2 and android tags and we might find your question there.. [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ksoap2]

And check out some of the tutorials from the [Links] wiki page.
