= How to see raw xml request and response e.g. for debugging? =

Turn debugging on for your httpTransport like so

{{{
httpTransport.debug = true;
}}}

and then set a breakpoint at 

{{{
httpTransport.call(soapaction, envelope);
}}}

inspect the values of

{{{
httpTransport.requestDump
httpTransport.responseDump
}}}

= Is there code generation off the WSDL somehow? =

There is the project [http://code.google.com/p/wsdl2ksoap/] that uses KSoap2-Android as well as a patch that enables something along these lines in upstream KSoap2 (details on [http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/issues/detail?id=34 issue 34]) however that is all I know about it..
