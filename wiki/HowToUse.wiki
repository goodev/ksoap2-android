#summary Find out how to use this library in your Android application

= How to Use =

== Apache Maven == 
To make use of this library in a Maven project, add the following to your project's POM:
{{{
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.code.ksoap2-android</groupId>
      <artifactId>ksoap2-android</artifactId>
      <version>3.4.0</version>
    </dependency>
  </dependencies>
  ...
</project>
}}}

and configure a proxy repository in your repository manager using the url 

{{{
http://ksoap2-android.googlecode.com/svn/m2-repo
}}}

If you are not using a repository manager like [http://www.sonatype.org/nexus Sonatype Nexus], you should start doing so now. 

As a stop gap solution you could add the repository to a profile in your settings.xml or pom.xml:

{{{
...
<repositories>		
  <repository>		
    <id>googlecode-ksoap2-android</id>		
    <name>googlecode-ksoap2-android</name>		
    <url>http://ksoap2-android.googlecode.com/svn/m2-repo</url>		
  </repository>		
</repositories>
}}}

Further libraries as part of the project are also published as part of the build and can be declared as dependencies as well, if needed.

== Standard Android Ant-based build and Eclipse/ADT  == 

To make use of this library in a non-Maven project, follow the instructions in the [http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html Android Developer's Guide] on how to [http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/faq/commontasks.html#addexternallibrary Add an External Library] to your project. 

You will need to add a ksoap2-android and all required transitive dependencies to the build path. Luckily the Maven build of the project produces a nice bundle of all these jars in one big file. 

The different version of these files are available at  [http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/#svn/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/]

*To download a file from there, right click on "View raw file" and select "Save Link as" (this label differs for different browsers) and you will get the full jar downloaded.*

The latest release artifact would be available at 

[http://code.google.com/p/ksoap2-android/source/browse/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/3.4.0/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.4.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar] 

with a direct download url of 

[http://ksoap2-android.googlecode.com/svn/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/3.4.0/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.4.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar]

*Some users seem to experience download problems with IE. Just try a decent browser or download with a command line tool like wget

{{{
wget http://ksoap2-android.googlecode.com/svn/m2-repo/com/google/code/ksoap2-android/ksoap2-android-assembly/3.4.0/ksoap2-android-assembly-3.4.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
}}}

*After the manual download confirm the size of the downloaded file since many users seem to be experiencing problems.* 

Or better just use Maven and a repository server.
