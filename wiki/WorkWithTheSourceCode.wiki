#summary This page describes how to work with the source code as a project member or committer as well as if you are just interested to build the project yourself.

= Requirement =

[http://maven.apache.org/ Apache Maven] installed.

= How to build the project and run the test =

To run the complete build including tests as well as bundle creation and so on run the command 

  `mvn clean install`

= How to do a release build =

To do a release build with a branch created in http://github.com/mosabua/ksoap2-android use

  `mvn release:prepare`

To build the artifacts of the release and deploy them to the google code svn repo use

  `mvn release:perform`

Note however that you can only cut a release if you have access rights to the github repository and the svn repo (= you are the project owner..).

== Fingerprint problem during release perform == 

If you run into an error message like this

[INFO] Error validating server certificate for 'https://ksoap2-android.googlecode.com:443':
[INFO]  - The certificate is not issued by a trusted authority. Use the
[INFO]    fingerprint to validate the certificate manually!
[INFO]  - The certificate hostname does not match.
[INFO] Certificate information:
[INFO]  - Subject: CN=*.googlecode.com, O=Google Inc, L=Mountain View, ST=California, C=US
[INFO]  - Valid: from Wed Jan 05 14:46:46 PST 2011 until Thu Jan 05 14:56:46 PST 2012
[INFO]  - Issuer: CN=Google Internet Authority, O=Google Inc, C=US

abort the release perform and run 
    `mvn deploy`

 manually. This will allow you to manually accept the certificate. Afterwards you can resume the release build with

   `mvn release:perform -Dresume=true`
