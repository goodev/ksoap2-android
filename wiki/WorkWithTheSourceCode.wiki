#summary This page describes how to work with the source code as a project member or committer as well as if you are just interested to build the project yourself.

= How to build the project =

  * run the command `mvn clean install`

= How to do a release build =

To do a release build with a branch created in http://github.com/mosabua/ksoap2-android use

  `mvn release:prepare`

To build the artifacts of the release and deploy them to the google code svn repo use

  `mvn release:perform`

Not however that you can only cut a release if you have access rights to the github repository and the svn repo (= you are the project owner..).
