Long ago there was the ksoap and then the ksoap2 projects. After a successful phase SOAP and with it the library pretty much died. (at least there were no release since 2006 or so)

Android then revived that since a lightweight framework to talk to legacy SOAP services was needed.

A patch set for Android [emerged](http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/9b246db7d612a6b5/5735094a5196c783?lnk=gst&q=ksoap2&pli=1#) on the "Android Developers" Google group authored by [Jorge Jimenez](http://groups.google.com/groups/profile?enc_user=Ey3jEg8AAACg1wBgVrjM04pX08V0u_rp).

Karl Michael Davis then took this patchset, set up a proper Apache Maven build as well as this project and did a few releases.

Since the project was largely unmaintained in 2009/2010 [Manfred Moser from simpligility technologies inc.](http://www.simpligility.com) took over the project, updated the wiki, created a mailinglist, applied and created further patches and released 2.5.1 and has been cutting numerous releases with a number of enhancements since then
